# The formula to calculate compound interest annually is given by: 

# A = P(1 + R/100) t 

# Compound Interest = A â€“ P 
# A is amount and P is the principal amount and R is the rate and T is the time span

def compound_interest(principal, rate, time):
    amount = principal * pow((1+rate/100),time)
    CI = amount - principal
    print(f"Compound intrest is {CI}")

## Compound Interest with Input taking from user

## Finding compound interest of given values without using pow() function.
