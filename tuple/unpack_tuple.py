# Exercise 4: Unpack the tuple into 4 variables
# Write a program to unpack the following tuple into four variables and display each variable.

# Given:

# tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40)
# Expected output:

# tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40)
# # Your code
# print(a) # should print 10
# print(b) # should print 20
# print(c) # should print 30
# print(d) # should print 40

tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40)
a,b,c,d = tuple1
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)
